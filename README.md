This is something I did in Python as a joke but it is a bit funny if I may say so myself. 
You can see the bot's profile here: https://old.reddit.com/user/quanteasingbot/ 
As you can see in the seventh through the ellventh lines of code, it is referencing a seperate file that takes care of logging the bot into Reddit, I did this so the login credentials would not be visible (duh). They are in a seperate file (you can see the import). 

The bot is at its earliest stage currently and all it does is give short lessons on the potential ramifications of the quantitative easing that ocurred in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis based on the word "spy" popping up in all of the major financial subreddits.
